# Leeds_Hydrogen_Absorption-Desorption
This repository contains the detailed project report and completion certificate for remote research internship at the University of Leeds. The internship was under Prof. Junfeng Yang, Associate Professor in the School of Mechanical Engineering and the Deputy Director of the Institute of Thermofluids. 
The project topic was to computationally simulate the hydrogen absorption/desorption in water and visualise the diffusion layer.
Software Used: ANSYS Fluent
Multiphase Model -> Volume of Fluid with 2 Eulerian Phases
Mass Transfer Rate dictated through User-Defined Function based on the Peng-Robinson Equation of State
